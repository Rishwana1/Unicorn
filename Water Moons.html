<p>Water Moon unicorns are strange, water-dwelling creatures, almost the polar opposite of their land-living cousins, Mountain Jewels. They are incredibly difficult to spot. The only time they are visible is on clear nights when they can be seen by the light of the moon and stars.<br><br>

A water moon unicorn could be a fantastical combination of a unicorn and elements associated with water and the moon. Typically, unicorns are depicted as horse-like creatures with a single horn, often symbolizing purity and grace. Adding elements of water and the moon could imbue the creature with themes of mysticism, tranquility, or even power tied to lunar cycles.<br><br>

A water moon unicorn might be imagined as a majestic creature with a pearlescent coat that shimmers like moonlight reflecting off water. Its horn could have a gentle iridescence, resembling a glowing crescent moon. This mythical being might inhabit serene bodies of water under the light of the full moon, embodying the mystical connection between water, the moon, and the purity often associated with unicorns. Legends could tell of its ability to bring harmony to turbulent waters or to guide lost souls under the moon's guidance.</p>
