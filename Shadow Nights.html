<p>Shadow unicorns were slightly larger than true unicorns, being some 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder. Their coats were always dappled grey, 
ranging in shade from dark coal-grey to a very pale steel-grey; the manes and tail were long, silky, and inky-black. The eyes were distinctly malevolent and 
burning red in colour. The characteristic unicorn horn, which could be 2​ to ​3 feet (61​ to ​91 centimeters) in length, was ebon black and sometimes, usually in battle
or to cause fright, surrounded by a corona of eerie crimson fire. <br><br>

Shadow unicorns were capable of hiding in the shadows of night and silencing the sound of their hooves, rendering them invisible and inaudible. 
When they chose to forgo stealth, however, and charged with thundering hooves and shrieking whinny, they magically caused fear in those who saw and heard them.<br>

Shadow unicorns were capable of magically teleporting themselves in a manner akin to the spell blink thrice each day, but only when shrouded in darkness. 
Moreover, shadow unicorns were immune to magical charm and hold spells, death magic, and all poisons.<br><br>

Their most destructive power was their ability to carve a glyph of gloom into a living tree, which caused the area within 100 yd (91 m) of it to descend into a forced 
twilight during the day; it also served to mark the shadow unicorn's claim on the region. A tree so marked withered and died within a year. A light spell provided a temporary 
countermeasure, and a continual light spell a more permanent one- at least until the shadow unicorn found and destroyed the spell.
